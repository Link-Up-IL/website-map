-Link Match dollars can be redeemed for products with fresh fruits and vegetables. To view the available options, go to topboxfoods.com/collections/linkmatch 
-When you’re ready to shop, add the products you’d like to order to your cart. At checkout, click Link Match to redeem the amount you’d like to save on the order.

Link Match can be redeemed in different amounts from $12.50 to $60, so you can use the right amount for the eligible products in your order.
-Your order will be delivered to your home on your chosen delivery day, so you can enjoy nutritious, fresh fruits and vegetables!
