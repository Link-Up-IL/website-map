We have a welcome/information table where we will have information and a staff member available to explain the Link Match Program; our farm stand staff will be able to explain the Link Match Program as well.  The farm stand cashier would provide the Link Match coupons after the purchase is made to be used at the next market.  We are completely open to suggestions on this plan though, as this is our first market season.     

Once we begin the mobile market, or indoor market for fall and winter, we will explain program in similar manner with vouchers distributed.

We partner with the Village of Maywood and Maywood Public LIbrary for marketing of the Summer Market. "
